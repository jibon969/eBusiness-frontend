            <!-- Exfoliation Guide -->
            <h2 class="fw-bold">All About Exfoliation!</h2>
            <div class="block-text">
            <p>If you are a COSRX user, you may know that exfoliation is important in a skincare routine. However, many people might not be familiar with the different types of chemical exfoliators or the ingredients contained in COSRX products.</p>
                
            <p>Today, we will introduce chemical exfoliators and recommend COSRX's exfoliators for you.</p>

            <hr>

                <!-- AHA Guide -->
            <h4> AHA - Water-Soluble Exfoliator</h4>
            <p>AHA is a water-soluble acid often derived from sources like sugar cane, fruits, and milk. It includes components such as Glycolic acid, Lactic acid, Citric acid, Malic acid, Mandelic acid, and Tartaric acid, which are widely used for exfoliation.</p>                    
            <p>AHA has a significant exfoliating effect by removing dead skin cells from the outermost layer of the skin. However, products with high concentrations can cause irritation, so care should be taken, especially for sensitive skin types.</p>
            <p>If you're new to AHA, it’s best to start with products that contain a lower concentration of AHA and increase gradually if needed.</p>

            <h5> Pure Daily Exfoliating for Beginners</h5>
            <p><strong>AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner</strong> - Glycolic Acid (AHA) 0.1%</p>

            <h5> Fast Exfoliating Option</h5>
            <p><strong>AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid</strong> - Glycolic Acid (AHA) 7%</p>

            <hr>

                <!-- BHA Guide -->
            <h4> BHA - Oil-Soluble Exfoliator</h4>
            <p>Salicylic acid (BHA) is oil-soluble and effective at removing dead skin cells from the outer layer while also cleaning out pores and excess sebum. Like AHA, high concentrations can be toxic, so moderate use is advised.</p>

            <p>Betaine Salicylate is a gentler version of BHA, known to provide similar effects with reduced irritation.</p>

            <h5> Wash-Off Cleanser for Excess Dead Skin and Sebum</h5>
            <p><strong>AC Collection Calming Foam Cleanser</strong> - Salicylic Acid (BHA) 0.5%</p>

            <h5> Leave-On Liquid for Daily Exfoliation</h5>
            <p><strong>BHA Blackhead Power Liquid</strong> - Betaine Salicylate (BHA) 4%</p>

            <hr>

            <!-- PHA Guide -->
            <h4> PHA - Gentle and Moisturizing Exfoliator</h4>
            <p>PHA is another exfoliating ingredient that is gentler than both AHA and BHA. It provides exfoliation while moisturizing the skin, making it a suitable choice for sensitive skin.</p>

            <h5> Wash-Off Cleanser for Dead Skin Cells</h5>
            <p><strong>Low pH Good Night Soft Peeling Gel</strong></p>

            <h5> Gentle Daily Exfoliating</h5>
            <p><strong>One Step Moisture Up Pad</strong></p>

            <hr>

                <!-- LHA Guide -->
            <h4> LHA - Mild Exfoliation for All Skin Types</h4>
            <p>Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (LHA) is a derivative of salicylic acid that acts slowly due to its larger molecular weight. It offers mild exfoliation and anti-aging effects, making it ideal for all skin types, including sensitive skin.</p>
            <h5> For Exfoliation, Pore Treatment, and Anti-Aging</h5>
            <p><strong>Poreless Pad</strong></p>

            <hr>

            <!-- Skincare FAQ: Toners Section -->
            <h2 class="fw-bold">Skincare FAQ: Toners? Toners!</h2>
            <div class="block-text">
                <p>You’re browsing through COSRX.com or other online beauty shops, or just walking through the aisle at your local drugstores, and you see so many products that people call “toners.” You’ve seen it, you may already be using it, and you probably heard from many people about how it’s an “essential part of their skincare routines.” But what really is a toner and why should you use it?</p>
                
                <h4>What are Toners?</h4>
                <p>In the old days, toners contained high concentrations of alcohol because the main purpose was to remove oil from the skin and make it less oily. The old toners often stung and dehydrated the skin by disrupting the skin’s oil and moisture balance. But hey, lots have changed over the past few years.</p>

                <p>Nowadays, toners are water-based cosmetic products (not alcohol!) that help clarify skin and add hydration after cleansing. Different categories of toners contain various acids, glycerin, antioxidants, and/or anti-inflammatories. Since toners are water-based, they penetrate quickly into the skin, delivering hydration from the inside out. Using a cotton pad or cotton ball to apply toners can help soften the skin texture by removing dead cells from the skin’s surface. After cleansing, filling pores with hydration, and removing dead cells, your skin is ready for other skincare products like serums or moisturizers.</p>

                <h4>When should I use it?</h4>
                <p>This is an easy question to answer: Right After Cleansing! After you wash your face with a cleanser, wiping your skin with a toner-soaked cotton pad helps remove any residual impurities while evening out the skin. The ingredients in toners penetrate best when the skin is wet, prepping it for the next products applied.</p>

                <h4>How should I apply toners?</h4>
                <p>There are many ways to apply toners. You can put some on your hands and tap it directly onto your skin. Alternatively, you can use cotton pads to wipe your face, working from the center outwards. Using cotton pads is ideal for soft exfoliation and evening out skin tone. If you want to take an extra step, you can try the “7 Skin Method,” a popular Korean skincare routine in which you apply small amounts of toner in seven layers. This method is perfect for extra hydration during dry seasons.</p>
