You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your account, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password.
                </p>

                <h2>Returns, Refunds and Title</h2>
                <p>BelaCosmetics does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return.

                Dhaka-1000, Bangladesh</strong></p></em>

                <p>Note: If we refund the money, the cost of bank transaction or Bkash will be paid by the customer.</p>
    
                <h3>Uses of products, effects of the products on human, authentication of the products and Brands and suggestions/recommendations by the Belasea help center:</h3>
                <p>We are not a dermatologist or producer of the brand. We only can ensure the authentication of the products and Brands. Our colleagues at the Help Centers are not dermatologists and do not know the details of the customer's history to provide suggestions or prescribe which products will be the right products for them. Our colleagues can only recommend to the customers; however, customers must purchase the products at their own risk regarding the uses, application, and effect of these products. We will not be held accountable for any misuse of the products or any negative effects on our customers or any other effects on the skin.</p>
    
                <h3>Review Comments Communications and Other Contact</h3>
                <p>You may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content; send e-cards and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages.</p>
    
                <h3>Intellectual Property Complaints</h3>
                <p>Belasea respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your intellectual property rights are being infringed, please follow our Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.</p>
    
                <h3>Risk of Loss</h3>
                <p>All purchases of physical items from Belasea are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.</p>
    
                <h3>Product Description</h3>
                <p>Belasea attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Belasea does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any Belasea Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by Belasea itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.</p>
    
                <h3>Pricing</h3>
                <p>“List Price” means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on Belasea and other retailers. Certain products may have a “Was Price” displayed, which is determined using recent price history of the product on Belasea.</p>
    
                <h3>About Price Matching</h3>
                <p>Belasea.com consistently works toward maintaining competitive prices on everything we carry. Belasea.com doesn't offer price matching.</p>
    
                <h3>About Shopping Cart Prices</h3>
                <p>Items in your Shopping Cart will always reflect the most recent price displayed on the item's product detail page. This price may differ from the price shown for the item when you first placed it in your cart.</p>
    
                <h3>Delivery Charge and Change of Shipping Address</h3>
                <p>Delivery charge from our office to the customer is non-refundable and paid by the customer, which is subject to change by the weight of the product, types of product, and delivery location.</p>
    
                <h3>Products which are on an offer price</h3>
                <p>If a product is on an offer price, the customer must do all the research about the expiry date, manufacturing date, and anything related to products to the Belasea help center before placing an order. Once the product has been dispatched, customers cannot complain about anything related to the product or request a return of the delivery cost.</p>
    
                <h3>Additional Belasea Software Terms</h3>
                <p>The following terms (“Software Terms”) apply to any software (including any updates or upgrades to the software) and any related documentation we make available to you in connection with Belasea Services (the "Belasea Software").</p>
    
                <h1 class="mt-5">Legal and Privacy Content</h1>
    
                <h2>App Permissions</h2>
                <p>When you use apps created by Belasea, such as the Belasea App, you may grant certain permissions to us for your device. Most mobile devices provide you with information about these permissions. To learn more about these permissions.</p>
    
                <h2>Sanctions and Export Policy</h2>
                <p>You may not use any Belasea Service if you are the subject of Bangladesh sanctions or of sanctions consistent with Bangladesh law imposed by the governments of the country where you are using Belasea Services. You must comply with all Bangladesh or other export and re-export restrictions that may apply to goods, software (including Belasea Software), technology, and services.</p>
    
                <h2>Other Businesses</h2>
                <p>Parties other than Belasea operate stores, provide services or software, or sell product lines through the Belasea Services. In addition, we provide links to the sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses. If you purchase any of the products or services offered by these businesses or individuals, you are purchasing directly from those third parties, not from Belasea. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings of any of these businesses or individuals (including the content of their Web sites). Belasea does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.</p>
    
                <h2>Disclaimer Of Warranties And Limitation Of Liability</h2>
                <p>The Belasea services and all information, content, materials, products (including software) and other services included on or otherwise made available to you through the Belasea services are provided by Belasea on an "as is" and "as available" basis, unless otherwise specified in writing. Belasea makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the Belasea services, or the information, content, materials, products (including software) or other services included on or otherwise made available to you through the Belasea services, unless otherwise specified in writing. You expressly agree that your use of the Belasea services is at your sole risk.</p>
    
                <p>To the full extent permissible by law, Belasea disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Belasea does not warrant that the Belasea services, information, content, materials, products (including software) or other services included on or otherwise made available to you through the Belasea services, Belasea's servers or electronic communications sent from Belasea are free of viruses or other harmful components. To the full extent permissible by law, Belasea will not be liable for any damages of any kind arising from the use of any Belasea service, or from any information, content, materials, products (including software) or other services included on or otherwise made available to you through any Belasea service, including, but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, and consequential damages, unless otherwise specified in writing.</p>
    
                <h2>Disputes</h2>
                <p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Belasea Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Belasea or through Belasea.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Bangladesh Arbitration Act and Bangladesh arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>
    
                <p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including Injunction and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</p>
    
                <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our office in Dhaka. The arbitration will be conducted by the Bangladesh Court according to the Arbitrator law.</p>
    
                <p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the Bangladesh Arbitrator law's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than BDT 10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Belasea will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>
    
                <p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
    
                <h2>Application Law</h2>
                <p>By using any Belasea Service, you agree that the Bangladesh Arbitration Act, applicable Bangladesh government law, and the laws of the ICT, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Belasea.</p>
    
                <h2>Site Policies Modification and Severability</h2>
                <p>Please review our other policies, such as our Privacy Notice, posted on this site. These policies also govern your use of Belasea Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions should be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p>
    
                <h2>Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Intellectual Property Infringement</h2>
                <p>If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been infringed, please notify us in writing at our office in Dhaka.</p>
    
                <h2>Comprehensive Privacy Notice</h2>
                <p>Your privacy is important to us. The Privacy Notice describes how we gather, store, and use customer information, including:</p>
                <ul>
